## What is semantic search?

Semantic search is the capability of computers to search by meaning, going beyond the typical keyword matching search.
Semantic search uses natural language processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning to understand the user's 
query, the context of the query and the user's intent. Semantic search looks at the relationship between words, 
or the meaning of words, to provide more accurate and relevant search results than traditional keyword searches.


Semantic search engines have many practical applications. For example, StackOverflow's "similar questions" feature is 
enabled by such a search engine. Additionally, they can be used to build a private search engine for internal documents 
or records. This article will show you how to build a basic semantic search engine. This article covers the usage of an archive 
of questions to embed, search with an index and nearest neighbour search and visualization based on the embeddings.

### Let's get started

For this Cohere AI tutorial we will use the example data that is provided by Cohere. You can find the full notebook code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cohere-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/Basic_Semantic_Search.ipynb) 

First we will get get the archive of questions, then embed them and finally search using an index and nearest neighbour search. At 
the end we will visualize the results based on the embeddings. To run this tutorial you will need to have a Cohere account. 
You can sign up for a free account [here](https://cohere.ai/).

Lets start by installing the necessary libraries.

```bash
!pip install cohere umap-learn altair annoy datasets tqdm
```

Then create a new notebook or Pythin file and import the necessary libraries.

```python
import cohere
import numpy as np
import re
import pandas as pd
from tqdm import tqdm
from datasets import load_dataset
import umap
import altair as alt
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)
```

#### Get the Archive of Questions

Next, we will get the archive of questions from Cohere. This archive is the [trec](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/trec) 
dataset, which is a collection of questions with categories. We will use the `load_dataset` function from the `datasets` library 
to load the dataset.

```python
# Get dataset
dataset = load_dataset("trec", split="train")
# Import into a pandas dataframe, take only the first 1000 rows
df = pd.DataFrame(dataset)[:1000]
# Preview the data to ensure it has loaded correctly
df.head(10)
```

#### Embed the Archive of Questions

Now we can embed the questions using Cohere. We will use the `embed` function from the Cohere library to embed the questions.
It should only take a few seconds to generate one thousand embeddings of this length.

```python
# Paste your API key here. Remember to not share publicly
api_key = ''

# Create and retrieve a Cohere API key from dashboard.cohere.ai/welcome/register
co = cohere.Client(api_key)

# Get the embeddings
embeds = co.embed(texts=list(df['text']),
                  model='large',
                  truncate='LEFT').embeddings
```

Now we can build the index and search for the nearest neighbours. We will use the `AnnoyIndex` function from the `annoy` library.
The optimization problem of finding the point in a given set that is closest (or most similar) to a given point is known as nearest neighbour search.

```python
# Create the search index, pass the size of embedding
search_index = AnnoyIndex(embeds.shape[1], 'angular')
# Add all the vectors to the search index
for i in range(len(embeds)):
    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])
search_index.build(10) # 10 trees
search_index.save('test.ann')
```

#### Find the Neighbours of an example from the dataset

We can use the index we built to find the nearest neighbours of both existing questions and new 
questions that we embed. If we're only interested in measuring the similarities between the questions 
in the dataset (no outside queries) a simple way is to calculate the similarities between every 
pair of embeddings we have.

```python
# Choose an example (we'll retrieve others similar to it)
example_id = 92
# Retrieve nearest neighbors
similar_item_ids = search_index.get_nns_by_item(example_id,10,
                                                include_distances=True)
# Format and print the text and distances
results = pd.DataFrame(data={'texts': df.iloc[similar_item_ids[0]]['text'],
                             'distance': similar_item_ids[1]}).drop(example_id)
print(f"Question:'{df.iloc[example_id]['text']}'\nNearest neighbors:")
results # only in notebooks, use print(results) in scripts
```

#### Find the Neighbours of a User Query

We can use a technique such as embedding to find the nearest neighbours of a user query. By 
embedding the query, we can measure its similarity with items in the dataset and identify the 
closest neighbours.

#### Visualization

```python
#@title Plot the archive {display-mode: "form"}

# UMAP reduces the dimensions from 1024 to 2 dimensions that we can plot
reducer = umap.UMAP(n_neighbors=20) 
umap_embeds = reducer.fit_transform(embeds)
# Prepare the data to plot and interactive visualization
# using Altair
df_explore = pd.DataFrame(data={'text': df['text']})
df_explore['x'] = umap_embeds[:,0]
df_explore['y'] = umap_embeds[:,1]

# Plot
chart = alt.Chart(df_explore).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
    x=#'x',
    alt.X('x',
        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)
    ),
    y=
    alt.Y('y',
        scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)
    ),
    tooltip=['text']
).properties(
    width=700,
    height=400
)
chart.interactive()
```

This brings us to an end to this introductory guide on semantic search using sentence embeddings. Going 
forward, when constructing a search product, there are additional factors to consider (e.g. handling 
lengthy texts or training to optimize the embeddings for a particular purpose). Feel free to explore 
and experiment with other data.
