Natural language processing is a field of computer science and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. In its simplest form, NLP is about developing algorithms that can automatically understand and produce human language.
The long-term goal of NLP is to create computational models of human language that can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks. These tasks include automatic translation, summarization, question answering, information extraction, and many others.
NLP research is highly interdisciplinary, involving researchers from fields such as linguistics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and computer science.

There are many different methods used in natural language processing, including rule-based methods, statistical methods, and neural computed methods.
Rule-based methods are usually based on hand-crafted rules that are written by NLP experts. These methods can be very effective for specific tasks, but they are often limited in their scope and require a lot of effort to maintain.
Statistical methods are based on using large amounts of data to train computational models. These models can then be used to automatically perform various NLP tasks.
Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for NLP tasks. Neural networks have been used to create state-of-the-art models for tasks such as machine translation and classification.

## ðŸ’¬ [Co:here](https://cohere.ai/)

Co:here is a powerful neural network, which can generate, embed, and classify text. In this tutorial we will use [Co:here](https://cohere.ai/) to classify descriptions. To use [Co:here](https://cohere.ai/) you need to create account on [Co:here](https://cohere.ai/) and get API key.

We will be programming in Python, so we need to install `cohere` library by `pip`
```python
pip install cohere
```

Firstly, we have to implement `cohere.Client`. In arguments of Client should be API key, which you have generated before, and version `2021-11-08`. I will create the class `CoHere`, it will be useful in the next steps.

```python
class CoHere:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.co = cohere.Client(f'{api_key}', '2021-11-08')
        self.examples = []
```

## ðŸ’¾ Dataset

The main part of each neural network is a dataset. In this tutorial, I will use a dataset that includes 1000 descriptions of 10 classes. If you want to use the same, you can download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jensenbaxter/10dataset-text-document-classification?resource=download).

The downloaded dataset has 10 folders in each folder is 100 `files.txt` with descriptions. The name of files is a label of description, e.g.`sport_3.txt`.

In this field, tasks are to read descriptions and labels from files and to create data, which contains description and label as one sample of data. Cohere classifier requires samples, in which each sample should be designed as a list `[description, label]`.

### Loading paths of examples

In the beginning, we need to load all data, to do that. We create the function `load_examples`. In this function we will use three external libraries:

`os.path` to go into the folder with data. The code is executed in a path where is a python's `file.py`. This is an internal library, so we do not need to install it.

`numpy` this library is useful to work with arrays. In this tutorial, we will use it to generate random numbers. You have to install this library by pip `pip install numpy`. 

`glob` helps us to read all files and folder names. This is an external library, so the installation is needed - `pip install glob`.

The downloaded dataset should be extracted in the folder `data`. By `os.path.join` we can get universal paths of folders. 

```python
folders_path = os.path.join('data', '*')
```

In windows, a return is equal to `data\*`.

Then we can use `glob` method to get all names of folders.

```python
folders_name = glob(folders_path)
```
`folders_name` is a list, which contains window paths of folders. In this tutorial, these are the names of labels. 
```python
['data\\business', 'data\\entertainment', 'data\\food', 'data\\graphics', 'data\\historical', 'data\\medical', 'data\\politics', 'data\\space', 'data\\sport', 'data\\technologie']
```
Size of `Co:here` training dataset can not be bigger than 50 examples and each class has to have at least 5 examples. With loop `for` we can get the names of each file. The entire function looks like that:

```python
import os.path
from glob import glob
import numpy as np

def load_examples():
    examples_path = []

    folders_path = os.path.join('data', '*')
    folders_name = glob(folders_path)

    for folder in folders_name:
        files_path = os.path.join(folder, '*')
        files_name = glob(files_path)
        for i in range(50 // len(folders_name)):
            random_example = np.random.randint(0, len(files_name))
            examples_path.append(files_name[random_example])
    return examples_path
```

The last loop is taking randomly 5 paths of each label and appending them into a new list `examples_path`.

### Load descriptions 

Now, we have to create a training set. To make it we will load examples with `load_examples()`. In each path is the name of a class, we will use it to create samples. Descriptions need to be read from files, a length can not be long, so in this tutorial, the length will be equal to 100. To list `texts` is appended list of `[descroption, class_name]`. Thus, a return is that list.

```python
def examples():
    texts = []
    examples_path = load_examples()
    for path in examples_path:
        class_name = path.split(os.sep)[1]
        with open(path, 'r', encoding="utf8") as file:
            text = file.read()[:100]
            texts.append([text, class_name])
    return texts
```

## ðŸ”¥ Co:here classifier

We back to `CoHere` class. We have to add two methods - to load examples and to classify input.

The first one is simple, `co:here` list of examples has to be created with the additional `cohere`'s method - `cohere.classify.Example`. 

```python
def list_of_examples(self):
        for e in examples():
            self.examples.append(Example(text=e[0], label=e[1]))
```

The second method is to classify the method from `cohere`. The method has serval arguments, such as:

`model` size of a model.

`inputs` list of data to classify.

`examples` list of a training set with examples

All of them you can find [here](https://docs.cohere.ai/classify-reference).

In this tutorial, the `cohere` method will be implemented as a method of our `CoHere` class. An argument of this method is a list of descriptions to predict.

```python
def classify(self, inputs):
        return self.co.classify(
            model='medium',
            inputs=inputs,
            examples=self.examples
        ).classifications
```

The return is `input`, `prediction` of input, and a list of `confidence`. `Confidence` is a likelihood list of each class. 
```python
cohere.Classification {
        input:
        prediction: 
        confidence: []
}
```

### `CoHere` class
```python
import cohere
from loadExamples import examples
from cohere.classify import Example

class CoHere:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.co = cohere.Client(f'{api_key}', '2021-11-08')
        self.examples = []

    def list_of_examples(self):
        for e in examples():
            self.examples.append(Example(text=e[0], label=e[1]))

    def classify(self, inputs):
        return self.co.classify(
            model='medium',
            taskDescription='',
            outputIndicator='',
            inputs=inputs,
            examples=self.examples
        ).classifications
```
## ðŸ“ˆ Web application - Streamlit

To create an application, in which will be a text input box and a likelihood display, we will use `Stramlit`. This is an easy and very useful library. 

Installation
```python
pip install streamlit
```

We will need two text inputs for `co:here` API key and for text to predict. 

In docs of [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/) we can find methods:

`st.header()` to make a header on our app

`st.test_input()` to send a text request

`st.button()` to create button

`st.write()` to display the results of cohere model.

`st.progress()` to display a progrss bar

`st.column()` to split an app


```python
st.header("Your personal text classifier - Co:here application")

api_key = st.text_input("API Key:", type="password")        #text box for API key 

description = [st.text_input("Description:")]               #text box for text to predict

cohere = CoHere(api_key)                                    #initialization CoHere
cohere.list_of_examples()                                   #loading training set 

if st.button("Classify"):   
    here = cohere.classify(description)[0]                  #prediction 
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
    for no, con in enumerate(here.confidence):              #display likelihood for each label
        if no % 2 == 0:                                     # in two columns
            col1.write(f"{con.label}: {np.round(con.confidence*100, 2)}%")
            col1.progress(con.confidence)
        else:
            col2.write(f"{con.label}: {np.round(con.confidence * 100, 2)}%")
            col2.progress(con.confidence)
```

To run the streamlit app use command
```python
streamlit run name_of_your_file.py
```

The created app looks like this

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion

Co:here models can be used not only to generate the text but also for classification. In this tutorial, we were able to classify a short text, with a small dataset. There were 50 examples for 10 classes. This was enough to keep the likelihood of prediction at a high level. The big dataset in some scenarios can be hard to produce, so Co:here model can be a great solution for it.

Identify a problem around you and [build cohere app](https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-top-5-ai-apps-you-can-build-with-cohere-api) to fix it.

Stay tuned for future tutorials!
