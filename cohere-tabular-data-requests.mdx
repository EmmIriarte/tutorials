Tabular data is a common format for storing and exchanging data. It is used in many applications, including data warehouses, data lakes and data marts. In this tutorial, we'll build a FastAPI application that uses Cohere to retrieve data from a table. It can be useful for building applications that need to retrieve data - like bots, dashboards or data explorers.

Identify a problem around you and [build cohere app](https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-top-5-ai-apps-you-can-build-with-cohere-api) to fix it.
 
## üé¨ Introduction
 
Of course we need to create a new project first. Let's create a new project using terminal:
 
```bash
mkdir cohere-tab-Data
 
cd cohere-tab-data
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
 
We have to create `.env` file and add our Cohere API key to it:
 
```
COHERE_API_KEY=<COHERE API KEY>
```
 
Now let's install necessary libraries:
 
```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install --upgrade cohere
    pip install fastapi[all]
```
 
Now we can create an `app.py` file and write code!
 
### üìù Let's code!
 
First, we need to import libraries:
 
```python
import os
import cohere
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from fastapi import FastAPI
 
load_dotenv()
```
 
Then we need to create a FastAPI application and set up a Cohere client:
 
```python
app = FastAPI()
 
co = cohere.Client(os.getenv('COHERE_API_KEY'))
```
 
I will define some example data that we will use in this tutorial:
 
```python
# Example data
COMPANY_DATA = '''
ID | Name | Position           | Department | Salary
---|------|--------------------|------------|--------
1  | John | Product Manager    | Sales      | 100000
2  | Emmy | UI/UX              | Design     | 90000
3  | Bob  | Software Developer | IT         | 120000
4  | Jane | Data Scientist     | IT         | 160000
5  | Mike | Software Developer | IT         | 130000
6  | Alex | Data Engineer      | IT         | 140000
7  | Bill | Software Developer | IT         | 120000
8  | Kate | Business Analyst   | Sales      | 110000
9  | Mark | UI/UX              | Design     | 95000
10 | Lisa | Social Media       | Marketing  | 80000
11 | Matt | Ads Manager        | Marketing  | 85000
12 | Tom  | SEO                | Marketing  | 80000
'''
 
# Some example queries for model
EXAMPLES = '''
Q: What is the average salary of the Design department?
A: 92500.0
---
Q: Who is the highest paid employee?
A: Alex
---
Q: Who is working in the IT department?
A: Bob, Jane, Mike, Alex, Bill
---
Q: How many employees are there in the Marketing department?
A: 3
---
'''
```
 
Now we can create request handler for our FastAPI application:
 
```python
@app.get('/')
async def data_retreival(request: str):
   
    prompt = f'{COMPANY_DATA}\n\n{EXAMPLES}\nQ: {request}'
    response = co.generate(
        model='xlarge',
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=5,
        temperature=0.75,
        stop_sequences=['--'],
    )
 
    return response.generations[0].text.strip()
```
 
Okay, now we can run our application:
 
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```
 
### üéâ Testing
 
Now we can test our application. Let's try to ask some questions:
 
```
Q: Who is the highest paid employee?
A: Jane
 
Q: How many employees are there in the IT department?
A: 5
 
Q: Who is the highest paid employee in Sales Department?
A: Kate
```
